Snake game has always been a memory for every child born in the digital age. It has often been most people's first game. Popularly known as the "Nokia Snake Game", it has been remade numerous amount of times on many different devices.

## How to Play

### Use Arrow keys to move the snake around. 
Up, Down, Left, and arrow keys can be used to move the snake in the respective directions

Eating the red food particles helps grow your snake. It also increases your score displayed on the top of the window.

Crashing into the boundaries of the window or into yourself results in **GAME OVER.**
